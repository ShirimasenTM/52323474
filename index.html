# **League of Legends – Next Season Notes (Clean Version)**

## **⏱ Jungle**

* Jungle camp timer: **1:30 → 0:55**
* Early clears slower
* Non-junglers have a harder time stealing camps
* Smite deals **more damage**
* Increased **gold & XP** from large monsters
* Bonus **movement speed** inside the jungle

---

## **🌋 Objectives**

### **Baron**

* Spawn time: **20:00**

### **Dragons**

* Dragons scale more over time
  → Become **tankier** one after another

---

## **❌ Removed**

* **Atagachi (Blood Rose / Petals)** → *bye bye*
* **Feats of Strength** → *removed*

---

## **🛡 Tower & Plate Changes**

* **Crystalline Overgrowth**

  * Stacks passively (even if tower isn't hit)
  * First attack detonates the stacks and damages the tower
  * Basically “almost Demolish 2.0”

* **Demolish Rework**

  * Stack first → then **3 auto attacks** to trigger damage

* **Turret plates now last forever**

  * Permanently stay on towers
  * **Inhibitor towers also get plates**
  * More opportunities to earn bonus plate gold (because stacks don’t disappear)

---

## **🧩 Role Quest System**

* Progress by doing:

  * Minions
  * Champion kills
  * Plates
  * Towers
  * Epic objectives
* Faster progress when played in **your correct lane**

  * e.g., ADC = botlane
